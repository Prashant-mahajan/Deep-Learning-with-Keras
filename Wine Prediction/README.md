Getting started with Deep Learning with easy to use Python library Keras.

Just run the notebook which has included following information: 

1. Exploring and Visualisation of the data
2. Preprocessing of the data
3. Building up  multi-layer perceptrons for classification tasks
4. Compile and fit the data to these models
5. Use model to predict the target values
6. Validate the model
7. A model for regression tasks and how to fine tune your model.
